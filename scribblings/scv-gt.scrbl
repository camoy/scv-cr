Soft contract verification for gradually-typed programs.

@section{Command Line}

The @exec{raco scv-gt} command allows you to optimize Typed
Racket programs using soft contract verification. It does
so by extracting the contracts generated by Typed Racket,
passing them to @exec{scv} for verification, and eliminating
all contracts that are proven safe statically.

The @exec{raco scv-gt} command accepts the following
command-line flags:

@itemlist[
@item{
  @exec{-s} or @exec{--show-contract} --- print the target
  modules with their contracts attached.
}

@item{
  @exec{-p} or @exec{--provide-less} --- do not attach
  contracts to provide forms.
}

@item{
  @exec{-r} or @exec{--require-less} --- do not attach
  contracts to require forms.
}
]

If you want to optimize many files at once, pass them all
as command-line arguments.
