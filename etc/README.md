# Measuring

A few quick scripts to run experiments.

1. Make sure you have `gtp-measure` installed and have cloned
   the `gtp-benchmark` repo.
2. Running `ruby main.rb` will start measurements with
   `scv-gt`.
3. Errors encountered during the process will be generated
   in `result.dat`.
4. Run `ruby report.rb result.dat` for the full report in
   Markdown.
